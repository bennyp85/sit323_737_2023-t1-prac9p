Calculator App - Microservices Architecture
This repository contains a calculator application built using a microservices architecture. The application consists of two services: authentication and CRUD operations. Each service is responsible for specific functionalities, providing a modular and scalable approach to building the calculator app.

Services
Authentication Service
The authentication service handles user authentication and authorization for accessing the calculator functionalities. It ensures that only authenticated users can perform calculations and access the CRUD operations.

For more information on running the Authentication service, please refer to the Authentication Service Readme.

CRUD Operations Service
The CRUD operations service provides the core functionality of the calculator app. It handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting calculations. Users authenticated by the authentication service can perform these operations through a well-defined API.

For detailed instructions on running the CRUD operations service, please refer to the CRUD Operations Service Readme.
